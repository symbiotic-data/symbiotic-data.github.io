# Symbiote Test Suite Definitions

## Topic

A `Topic` is just an alias for a String, whatever that is for your platform. When serialized, it will be
UTF-8 encoded.

```haskell
data Topic = Topic String
```

### Generate

Generating Unicode strings can be tricky business. It is common for operating systems to treat surrogate
characters as special, and should therefore be avoided. See [this Wikipedia article on UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16#U+D800_to_U+DFFF) (which is what JavaScript uses under-the-hood) for more details.

```haskell
generate :: Gen Topic
generate = do
  characters <- arrayOf (arbitraryChar `suchThat` isNotSurrogate)
  return (Topic (arrayToString characters))
```

### JSON

`Topic` values are encoded as a plain JSON string.

```haskell
encodeJson :: Topic -> Json
encodeJson (Topic t) = stringAsJson t
```

### Binary

This protocol is required to support JavaScript, which does not support 64-bit integers natively. Therefore,
the encoding mechanism used here will do a standard UTF-8 encoding with a 32-bit size index of the bytestring.

```haskell
encodeBinary :: Topic -> ByteString
encodeBinary (Topic t) =
  (intAsByteStringBE (length t :: Int32))
    ++ (stringAsByteString t)
```

## Size

JavaScript does not support 64-bit integers, so it is our lowest-common-denominator for this test suite,
and we should use 32-bit integers whenever we need an `Int`.

```haskell
data Size = Size Int32
```

### Generate

```haskell
generate :: Gen Size
generate = do
  size <- between 0 (2^31 - 1)
  return (Size size)
```

### JSON

JavaScript can handle 32-bit integers, so we can directly use our `Size` in a JSON document.

```haskell
encodeJson :: Size -> Json
encodeJson (Size s) = intAsJson s
```

### Binary

```haskell
encodeBinary :: Size -> ByteString
encodeBinary (Size s) = intAsByteStringBE s
```

## AvailableTopics

In a platform's implementation, an `AvailableTopics` is just a mapping from `Topic`s to `Size`s -
this could be a HashMap, a B-tree map, or a JSON object.

```haskell
data AvailableTopics = AvailableTopics (Map Topic Size)
```

### Generate

```haskell
generate :: Gen AvailableTopics
generate = do
  pairs <- arrayOf (pairOf arbitraryTopic arbitrarySize)
  return (AvailableTopics (arrayToMap pairs))
```

### JSON

This data type is the same as a JSON object of integers, so we'll use that for its JSON encoding.

```haskell
encodeJson :: AvailableTopics -> Json
encodeJson (AvailableTopics ts) = mapAsJsonObject ts
```

### Binary

A `Topic` tells us how many bytes it uses in its first 32-bit value, while `Size` is always 4 bytes
because its a 32-bit integer. Therefore, a pair of a `Topic` and `Size` can be stored right next
to each other, and the only thing we have have to worry about is storing _how many_ pairs there are.

```haskell
encodeBinary :: AvailableTopics -> ByteString
encodeBinary (AvailableTopics ts) =
  (intAsByteStringBE (length ts :: Int32))
    ++ (arrayAsByteString (map pairToByteString (mapToArray ts)))
  where
    pairToByteString :: (Topic, Size) -> ByteString
    pairToByteString (t,s) = (encodeBinary t) ++ (encodeBinary s)
```

## Generating

A `Generating` message is sent by the peer doing the generating, and received by the peer operating.
There are a few options to consider - it's an enumerated type. Furthermore, it's defined here generically
over its serialized type, but the idea is the same.

```haskell
data Generating target
  = Generated (value :: target) (operation :: target)
  | BadResult (result :: target)
  | YourTurn
  | ImFinished
  | NoParseOperated (result :: target)
```

Note that we are not using type `T` or `OperationsOnT` here - we may have many different types to deal with,
and therefore can't be constrained to one universal type. However, there is only one `Target` type over
the `Socket` we communicate over, and can therefore be defined against that.

### JSON

This type's enumerated options are distinguished by varying keys in a JSON object.

```haskell
encodeJson :: Generating Json -> Json
encodeJson x = case x of
  Generated value operation -> {"generated": {"value": value, "operation": operation}}
  BadResult result -> {"badResult": result}
  YourTurn -> stringAsJson "yourTurn"
  ImFinished -> stringAsJson "imFinished"
  NoParseOperated result -> {"noParseOperated": result}
```

### Binary

The different enumerated options will be distinguished by a varying initial byte flag.

```haskell
encodeBinary :: Generating ByteString -> ByteString
encodeBinary x = case x of
  Generated value operation ->
    (byteAsByteString 0)
      ++ (byteStringWithLength value)
      ++ (byteStringWithLength operation)
  BadResult result ->
    (byteAsByteString 1)
      ++ (byteStringWithLength result)
  YourTurn -> byteAsByteString 2
  ImFinished -> byteAsByteString 3
  NoParseOperated result ->
    (byteAsByteString 4)
      ++ (byteStringWithLength result)
```

Where `byteStringWithLength` prefixes the `ByteString`'s byte-length as a 32-bit integer.


## Operating

An `Operating` message is sent by the peer doing the operating, and received by the peer that generated.

```haskell
data Operating target
  = Operated (result :: target)
  | NoParseValue (value :: target)
  | NoParseOperation (operation :: target)
```

### JSON

```haskell
encodeJson :: Operating Json -> Json
encodeJson x = case x of
  Operated result -> {"operated": result}
  NoParseValue value -> {"noParseValue": value}
  NoParseOperation operation -> {"noParseOperation": operation}
```

### Binary

```haskell
encodeBinary :: Operating ByteString -> ByteString
encodeBinary x = case x of
  Operated result ->
    (byteAsByteString 0)
      ++ (byteStringWithLength result)
  NoParseValue value ->
    (byteAsByteString 1)
      ++ (byteStringWithLength value)
  NoParseOperation operation ->
    (byteAsByteString 2)
      ++ (byteStringWithLength operation)
```

Where `byteStringWithLength` prefixes the `ByteString`'s byte-length as a 32-bit integer.

## First

These are the messages sent by the `First` party in the protocol.

```haskell
data First target
  = Topics AvailableTopics
  | FirstGenerating Topic (Generating target)
  | FirstOperating Topic (Operating target)
```

### JSON

```haskell
encodeJson :: First Json -> Json
encodeJson x = case x of
  Topics availableTopics ->
    {"availableTopics": encodeJson availableTopics}
  FirstGenerating topic generating ->
    { "firstGenerating":
      { "topic": encodeJson topic
      , "generating": encodeJson generating
      }
    }
  FirstOperating topic operating ->
    { "firstOperating":
      { "topic": encodeJson topic
      , "operating": encodeJson operating
      }
    }
```

### Binary

```haskell
encodeBinary :: First ByteString -> ByteString
encodeBinary x = case x of
  Topics availableTopics ->
    (byteAsByteString 0)
      ++ (encodeBinary availableTopics)
  FirstGenerating topic generating ->
    (byteAsByteString 1)
      ++ (encodeBinary topic)
      ++ (encodeBinary generating)
  FirstOperating topic operating ->
    (byteAsByteString 2)
      ++ (encodeBinary topic)
      ++ (encodeBinary operating)
```

## Second

These are the messages sent by the `Second` party in the protocol.

```haskell
data Second target
  = BadTopics AvailableTopics
  | Start
  | SecondOperating (Operating target)
  | SecondGenerating (Generating target)
```

### JSON

```haskell
encodeJson :: Second Json -> Json
encodeJson x = case x of
  BadTopics availableTopics ->
    {"badTopics": encodeJson availableTopics}
  Start -> stringAsJson "start"
  SecondOperating topic operating ->
    { "secondOperating":
      { "topic": encodeJson topic
      , "operating": encodeJson operating
      }
    }
  SecondGenerating topic generating ->
    { "secondGenerating":
      { "topic": encodeJson topic
      , "generating": encodeJson generating
      }
    }
```

### Binary

```haskell
encodeBinary :: Second ByteString -> ByteString
encodeBinary x = case x of
  BadTopics availableTopics ->
    (byteAsByteString 0)
      ++ (encodeBinary availableTopics)
  Start -> byteAsByteString 1
  SecondOperating topic operating ->
    (byteAsByteString 2)
      ++ (encodeBinary topic)
      ++ (encodeBinary operating)
  SecondGenerating topic generating ->
    (byteAsByteString 3)
      ++ (encodeBinary topic)
      ++ (encodeBinary generating)
```
